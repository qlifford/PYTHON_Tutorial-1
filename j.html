        List	Tuple	Set	Dictionary
A list is a non-homogeneous data structure that stores the elements in columns of a single row or multiple rows.

A Tuple is a non-homogeneous data structure that stores elements in columns of a single row or multiple rows.

The set data structure is non-homogeneous but stores the elements in a single row.

A dictionary is also a non-homogeneous data structure that stores key-value pairs.

The list can be represented by [ ]

A tuple can be represented by  ( )

The set can be represented by { }

The dictionary can be represented by { }

The list allows duplicate elements

Tuple allows duplicate elements

The Set will not allow duplicate elements

The dictionary doesn’t allow duplicate keys.

The list can be nested among all

A tuple can be nested among all

The set can be nested among all

The dictionary can be nested among all

Example: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Example: (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

Example: {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}

Example: {1: “a”, 2: “b”, 3: “c”, 4: “d”, 5: “e”}

A list can be created using the list() function

Tuple can be created using the tuple() function.

A set can be created using the set() function

A dictionary can be created using the dict() function.

A list is mutable i.e we can make any changes in the list.

A tuple is immutable i.e we can not make any changes in the tuple.

A set is mutable i.e we can make any changes in the set, its elements are not duplicated.

A dictionary is mutable, its Keys are not duplicated.

List is ordered

Tuple is ordered

Set is unordered

Dictionary is ordered (Python 3.7 and above)

Creating an empty list

l=[]

Creating an empty Tuple

t=()

Creating a set

a=set()
b=set(a)

Creating an empty dictionary

d={}
